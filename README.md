What is a keylogger (keystroke logger or system monitor)?
A keylogger, sometimes called a keystroke logger, is a type of surveillance technology used to monitor and record each keystroke on a specific device, such as a computer or smartphone. It can be either hardware- or software-based. The latter type is also known as system monitoring software or keyboard capture software.

Why are keyloggers used?
Keyloggers are often used as a spyware tool by cybercriminals to steal personally identifiable information, login credentials and sensitive enterprise data.

That said, some uses of keyloggers could be considered ethical or appropriate in varying degrees. For instance, keyloggers can also be used for the following reasons:

By employers to observe employees' computer activities.
By parents to supervise their children's internet usage.
By device owners to track possible unauthorized activity on their devices.
By law enforcement agencies to analyze incidents involving computer use.
